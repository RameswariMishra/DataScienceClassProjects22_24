These are the Data Science Course Projects, University of Missouri, Columbia, I have worked on during my MS in Data Science and Analytics.

Effect of COVID-19 Vaccination (Data Visualization): 
Conducted comparative trend analysis of vaccination effects in Alabama, Missouri, and NY.
Demonstrated reduced COVID-19 deaths and infection rates with increased vaccination rates.

Lung Cancer Prediction:

Conducted feature importance analysis to identify key predictors.	

Multi-Year Chicago Crime Database Design, ETL, and Analytics:	
Analyzed crime and arrest trends using PostgreSQL queries and data visualization.
Highlighted decreasing crime counts and narrowing gap between crime counts and arrests.
